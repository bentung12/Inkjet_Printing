# Continuous Inkjet Printing Simulation (MATLAB)

This project simulates how **continuous inkjet printers (CIJPs)** deflect and place ink droplets onto a substrate using electric fields.  
It converts an input image into a sequence of voltage waveforms that would be applied to deflection plates, showing how characters or shapes could be printed.

## üñ®Ô∏è Background

Continuous inkjet printers operate by:
1. Breaking up an ink stream into droplets using piezoelectric oscillation.
2. Charging selected droplets with a charging electrode.
3. Deflecting charged droplets using electric fields between deflection plates so they land in the correct positions on the substrate:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

This project demonstrates that process in simulation:
- An input image (black/white) is translated into a **voltage waveform vector**.
- Each voltage corresponds to a deflection needed to place an ink droplet at the right location.
- A `0 V` entry indicates a line change (printer carriage moves to next row).
- Droplet placement is visualized as scatter plots and animated GIFs.

Compared to **drop-on-demand (DOD) printers**, CIJPs are faster and more common in industrial packaging, though less precise.

## ‚ú® Features

- MATLAB implementation (`.mlx` live script) with full comments.
- Converts any image into an **electric field matrix** and then a **voltage waveform vector**.
- Generates:
  - **Voltage vs. Time waveform plot**
  - **Reconstructed substrate output (scatter plot)**
  - **Animated GIFs** showing the printing process line by line.

## üöÄ Usage

1. Open the `.mlx` file in **MATLAB** (R2022a or later recommended).
2. Run the script ‚Äî it will:
   - Read in an input image (matrix format).
   - Compute the required electric field at each pixel.
   - Convert that field into a **voltage waveform vector**.
   - Generate output plots and save animations.
3. Replace the input image with your own (black/white works best).
